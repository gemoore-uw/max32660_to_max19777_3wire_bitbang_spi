The 'GPIO' project is a simple program for the MAX32660
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX32660 Evaluation
Kit.

Example functionality:
  -  Uses GPIO as inputs and outputs

  -  The example reads P0.12 (S1) and outputs the input value onto
     P0.13 (DS1).

  -  Uses the GPIO IRQ and responds to events on P0.3.
     *  When P0.3 changes state, the IRQ handler toggles P0.2.

  -  Status is transmitted via stdout using UART0 to
     a host terminal at 115,200 Baud, 8N1.
